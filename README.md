# Scrapetron
Scrapetron is a Python package for web scraping that provides a simple and intuitive API for extracting data from websites. With Scrapetron, you can easily scrape web pages and extract information such as text, images, links, and more.

## Installation
You can install Scrapetron using pip:

```
pip install scrapetron
```

## Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use Scrapetron to scrape a web page:

```python
from scrapetron import Scrapetron
url = 'https://www.example.com'
scraper = Scrapetron(url)
data = scraper.get_text()
print(data)
```
Here in this example, we create a new Scrapetron object with the URL of the web page we want to scrape. We then call the get_text method to extract the text content of the page.
